OCI Architecture
Regions -> AD -> FD 

Choosing a Region:
Location:
Choose a region closest to your users for lowest latency and highest performance!
Data Residency & Compliance:
Many countries have strict data residency requirements.
Service Availability:
New cloud services are made available based on regional demand, regulatory compliance, resource availability, and other factors.

Availability Domains:
Isolated from each other, fault tolerant, unlikely to fail simultaneously.
Physical infrastructure not shared

Fault Domains:
Each Availability Domain has three Fault Domains (FD).
Logical data center within an AD
Resources placed in different FDs will not share single points of hardware failure
In any region, resources in at most ONE fault domain are being actively changed at any point in time. This means that availability problems caused by change procedures are isolated at the fault domain level.
You can control the placement of your compute or database instances to fault domains at instance "launch" time.

Oracle Cloud ID (OCID)
ocid1. <RESOURCE TYPE>. <REAIM>. [REGION] [. FUTURE USE]. <UNIQUE ID>

Compartments
Six levels of Nesting allowed

Policies - Human readable statements to define granular permissions:
Allow group <group name> to ‹verb> <resource-type> in tenancy
Allow group <group name> to ‹verb> <resource-type> in compartment ‹compartment name> [where <conditions>1]
Policy Attachment - To a compartment or the tenancy
Policies are only applied to groups but not users 

Verb: manage, use, read, inspect

Aggregate resource-type:
all-resources
database-family
instance-family
object-family
virtual-network-family
volume-family

Best practice: Don't Use the Tenancy Administrator Account for Day-to-Day Operations
Best practice: Create dedicated compartments to isolate resources
Best practice: Enforce the use of Multi-Factor Authentication (MA)

AM resources do not have an aggregate resource type: True

Policies - OCI Admin: Least Amount of Policies: 
Allow group OCI-admin-group to manage all-resources in tenancy
Allow group OCI-admin-group to manage domains in tenancy
Allow group OCI-admin-group to manage users in tenancy
Allow group OCI-admin-group to manage groups in tenancy
Allow group OCI-admin-group to manage dynamic-groups in tenancy
Allow group OCI-admin-group to manage policies in tenancy
Allow group OCI-admin-group to manage compartments in tenancy

VCN:
VCN is a regional service 
No entry in route table needed for routing data between public and private subnets. VCN takes care of that. 
Longest specific match gets more priority for routing 
SAME OCI Region: networks talk to each through "local peering" using local peering gateway (LPG)
Different OCI regions: networks communicate with each other through Remote peering using dynamic routing gateways 
Dynamic routing gateway v2: for more networks within the OCI region to communicate with each other, (maybe 300 + networks), instead of local peering, DRG v2 can be used.
Security Lists: firewall Rules associated to a subnet and applied to all instances in the subnet 
Stateful: if traffic is allowing in through a port, it is always allowed out as well 

Route Table
VCN uses virtual route tables to send traffic out of the VCN (for example, to the internet, to your on-premises network, or to a peered VCN). These route tables have route rules that provide mapping for traffic from subnet via gateways to other subnets or destinations outside VCN
Each rule specifies a destination CIDR block and the target (the next hop) for any traffic that matches that CIDR.
Security List
Security List is a common set of firewall rules associated with a subnet and applied to all compute instances in that subnet. Security List specifies two types of traffic allowed:
* Ingress: Incoming Traffic
* Egress: Outgoing Traffic
Firewall rules in OCI are defined at the subnet level and not at compute instance level.
Network Security Group
Network Security Groups are another method for implementing security rules. NSGs provides a virtual firewall for a set of Cloud resources that have the same security posture.
Read our blog to know more about Network Security Groups Vs. Security List: When to use What?
Gateways
There are 5 gateways in OCI Networking:
1) Internet Gateway (IG): It provides a path for network traffic between the internet and OCI VCN. Compute Instance in Public Subnet by default won’t be able to connect to the internet without IG.
2) NAT Gateway: It gives resources without public IP addresses access to the internet without allowing incoming traffic from the internet to that resources.
3) Service Gateway: It allows OCI resources to access public OCI services without the use of the Internet or NAT Gateway Eg: Object Storage.
4) Dynamic Routing Gateway (DRG): DRG provides a single point of entry for remote network paths coming into VCN. It provides a path for VCNs to communicate across regions or outside the region to On-premise. Each VCN can have a single DRG.
5) Local Peering Gateway (LPG): Used to establish communication between resources of different VCNs within a Region.
Read our blog to know more in detail about Gateways in OCI: Internet Gateway, NAT Gateway, Service Gateway, Dynamic Routing Gateway

VCN Peering
* VCN Peering is the process of connecting multiple virtual cloud networks (VCN)
* With peering, instances in two VCNs communicate as if they are in the same network
* VCN Peering can be of two types Local VCN Peering (within Region) using LPG & Remote VCN Peering (across Regions) using DRG.
    * Local VCN Peering(LPG): The process of creating a path between VCNs for communication in a single region.
    * Remote Peering Connection: The process of creating a path between VCNs communication across regions.
* Local VCN Peering is supported in all OCI Regions.

Security List: A set of firewall rules that apply to all resources in a subnet
Network Security Group: A set of firewall rules that apply to any set of resources in a VCN that you specify
[ port 80: web servers on compute instances ] 
[ port 1521: ? ]

Load Balancer: Used for high availability and high scalability; higher level of routing intelligence (looks at packets)
Layer 7 load balancer: HTTP/HTTPS; 
2 types if shapes for LB: 
-> Scalable - Flexible/ Dynamic shapes: define min, max and range, LB supports any traffic in that range: 10 mbps - 8 gbps
-> Predefined Shape: Small , med and large; no warmup required; automatically scales 
LB can be public or private

Network Load Balancer: Much faster and lower latency: used for high performance 
OCI Network Load Balancer operates at layer 4 (transport layer) of the OS model.
It distributes traffic among instances within its backend set based on TCP or UDP protocols.

Specify a load balancing policy:
Weighted round robin: This policy distributes incoming traffic sequentially to each server in a backend set list.
IP hash: This policy ensures that requests from a particular client are always directed to the same backend server.
Least connections: This policy routes incoming request traffic to the backend server with the fewest active connections.

Configure listener for a load balancer:
A listener is a logical entity that checks for incoming traffic on the load balancer's IP address. To handle TCP, HTTP and HTTPS traffic, you must configure at least one listener per traffic type. You can configure additional listeners after you create your load balancer.

COMPUTE: 
- types: VM [shared, multi-tenant], Bare meter servers [dedicated servers/machine, not shared], Dedicated host [ dedicated BM machine + VM on top of that, not shared] 
- offers scalability, high performance, lower pricing 
- Flexible shapes: OCPUs, Memory 
- AMD, intel, ampere (arm - based, and best if the bunch, higher performance and lower cost) 
- pricing model: pay as you go, Universal Credits
- Preemptive VMS: Low Cost, Short lived VMs, Batch Jobs, Fault tolerant workloads, 50% cheaper

Launching a compute instance Steps: 
VCN [wizard, cidr block] > subnet [cidr block, route table] > internet gateway > add route rules > security list [port 80 for web servers] > create instance  [ cloose AD, capacity type, fault domain (leave it to oracle to choose), image (OS) and shape (VM or BM, cpu, memory, flex means flexible shapes), VCN, subnet, ssh keys (public key)] 
You can now SSH to this instance. 

Scaling: 
Vertical: 
Scale-up and scale-down instance shape supported
New shape must have same hardware architecture
Downtime required
Stop instance before vertical scaling 

Horizontal or Auto scaling:  
for high availability 
Enables large-scale deployment of VMs
Scale-out or scale-in
One VM fails, others keep working
Match traffic demand by adding/removing VMs automatically

To Autoscale:
Running instance > Config [OS image, metadata, shapes, VNICs, Storage, subnets] > instance pool [Put in different Availability Domains, Manage all together (stop, start, terminate)] > scaling rules [ min and max size ]

OKE [ Oracle containers using kubernetes]:
VM: hardware > hyperviser > VMs [app, libs, OS]
Containers: Hardware > OS > Container runtime [docker] > Container [app, lib] 

Disadvantages of VMs:
Higher Utilization of Resources Compared to On-Premises
Multiple VMs
Multiple OS
Higher Disk Space
Longer Boot Time

Advantages of containers: 
Faster Boot Time

Greatly simplifies deployment operations

Docker is used to manage and build the containers.
Docker as a container runtime is no longer supported after Kubernetes v1.20 (other runtimes like CRI-O are used instead)
Kubernetes links containers running on multiple hosts and orchestrates them.
Containers communicate with each other via Kubernetes.

Additional notes:

The key difference between Security Lists and Network Security Groups in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure is that Security Lists apply to subnets, while Network Security Groups apply to individual instance VNICs. This allows for more granular control of traffic in and out of instances.

A Route Table is a component in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Networking Service that defines rules for packet forwarding to destinations outside the Virtual Cloud Network (VCN). Route Tables have rules to route traffic from subnets to destinations outside the VCN by way of gateways or specially configured instances.

A Dynamic Routing Gateway (DRG) provides a path for traffic between a VCN and an on-premises network or another VCN in the same or different region.

A Service Gateway in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure networking service enables access to Oracle services within the same region without the traffic going through the public internet. This provides a more secure and reliable connection for accessing Oracle services like Object Storage, Autonomous Database, and others.

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Web Application Firewall (WAF) is designed to protect your web applications from various types of malicious attacks, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting. WAF inspects incoming web traffic and filters out any requests that match predefined security rules, ensuring the security and availability of your web applications.

In Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, Security Lists are responsible for controlling traffic between subnets within a virtual cloud network (VCN). They define ingress and egress rules to determine the allowed traffic at the subnet level.

The self-securing feature of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Autonomous Database provides automatic application of security patches and protection from threats. It ensures that the database is always up-to-date with the latest security updates, helping to safeguard your data and maintain a strong security posture.

In Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, the "Principal" component of an IAM policy statement defines the user or group the policy applies to. It specifies the groups that the policy statement affects, granting them access to resources and actions defined in the policy statement.
